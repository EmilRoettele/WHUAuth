Issue: Camera Tab Lifecycle Freeze
Keyword: useFocusEffect
Description: Camera stream froze when switching between tabs because the camera component wasn't handling React Navigation's focus/blur lifecycle. Fixed by using useFocusEffect to properly activate/deactivate camera based on tab focus state.
